Shopping Cart Web Application
This is a simple web application for a shopping cart, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the Products.js file for product data. The application allows users to view a list of products, add items to the cart, add items to favorites, and manage their cart.

Features
Product Display: Products are dynamically displayed on the webpage using JavaScript based on the data provided in the Products.js file.

Add to Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart. The "Add to cart" button becomes disabled if the item is already in the cart.

Add to Favorites: Users can add products to their favorites. The "Like" button becomes disabled if the item is already in the favorites.

Shopping Cart: The shopping cart displays added items, and users can increment, decrement, or remove items. Total price and item count are updated accordingly.

Timer: A timer shows the remaining time until a specific date (e.g., a sale end date).
